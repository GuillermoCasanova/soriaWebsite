<h2>Forensic Accounting-Fraud Services</h2>

<p>Services designed to help your company or attorneys detect, deter, and investigate fraud. In detection and investigation services we can include asset tracing, forensic accounting, computer forensics, interviews and interrogations, and expert reports and testimony. Deterrence services include evaluating your company’s current anti-fraud plan and infrastructure, policy development and implementation, computer system analyses, accounting procedures implementation, evaluation of internal controls and fraud awareness training.</p>

<p>A fraud prevention analysis investigates day-to-day transactions and tests internal controls to determine if business leaks and defalcations exist or could exist.</p>

<p>The criminal activity uncovered may include fraud, embezzlement, money laundering, and concealment of debt, concealment of assets or other fraudulent activities, or even financial crimes. Forensic accountants may be called upon to testify in court as expert witnesses in criminal and civil litigation and appear in pretrial depositions.</p>

<p>Some of the cases that we have worked on involved:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Investigation of embezzlement and other fraudulent schemes</li>
    <li>Investigation of fraudulent financial statements</li>
    <li>Assist management in gathering and preserving electronic evidence</li>
    <li>Assist attorneys and public prosecutors with the documentation and evaluation of evidence to be used in trial</li>
</ul>

<h2>ERM–Risk Management Services</h2>

<p>Soria, LLC, may help with risk management and risk reduction through an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) evaluation or a customized design of accounting and auditing systems and procedures.</p>

<p>ERM are methods and processes used by organizations to manage risks and identify opportunities related to the achievement of their goals and objectives. ERM provides a framework for risk management, which typically involves identifying particular events or circumstances relevant to the organization's objectives (risks and opportunities), assessing them in terms of likelihood and magnitude of impact, determining a response strategy, and monitoring progress. By identifying and proactively addressing risks and opportunities, business enterprises protect and create value for their stakeholders, including owners, employees, customers, regulators, and financing institutions. Inadequate risk management can result in severe consequences for companies as well as individuals.</p>

<p>An ERM usually includes the evaluation of these four main risk areas:</p>
<li>Strategic</li>
<li>Compliance</li>
<li>Financial</li>
<li>Operational</li>

<p>We have performed the following projects regarding ERM:</p>
<li>ERM awareness training</li>
<li>ERM program implementation</li>
<li>ERM program effectiveness monitoring</li>
<li>Evaluation of compliance with laws and regulations</li>
<li>Evaluation of effectiveness and efficiency of operations</li>
<li>Assessment of internal controls</li>


<hr>

<h2>Due Diligence Services</h2>

<p>Due Diligence is a field of specialized knowledge, which helps reduce the risk of acquiring unseen liabilities and risk exposures associated with a commercial transaction. As a function of due diligence and investmen</p>t analysis, we will advise on a wide variety of financial transactions:

<ul>
    <li>• Contemplated mergers and acquisitions</li>
    <li>• Venture capital investments</li>
    <li>• Bankruptcy proceedings</li>
</ul>

<p>Our experience and unique blend of legal and financial knowledge provides us the opportunity of a rounded evaluation of the feasibility of a transaction both from the sellers and purchasers point of view.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Transfer Pricing Studies</h2>
<p>We have experience performing transfer pricing studies according to IRC section 482 and the OECD standards. Transfer prices are the prices at which services, tangible property and intangible property are traded across international borders between related parties. Transfer pricing is important because a change in the transfer price would affect the profits of the business subject to tax.</p>

<p>Transfer pricing covers the tax levied on inter-company transactions (i.e. affiliated companies). A primary goal of the related regulations is to make certain that such transactions are handled as if there were no company affiliation. A concept called arm’s length transaction.
    Meeting transfer-pricing requirements can be extremely complex in today’s global economic environment.</p>

<p>We have experience performing the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Determine arm’s length royalty rate</li>
    <li>Determine arm’s length licencing fee</li>
    <li>Determine arm’s length transfer of intangible property</li>
    <li>Determine arm’s length service agreement</li>
    <li>Determine arm’s length consignment fee</li>
    <li>Determine arm’s length management fee</li>
</ul>

<b>TODO: Consider Making more Consise </b>

<p>We have experience determining arm's length royalty rates, licencing fees, transfers of intangible properties, service agreements, consignment fees, and management fees. </p>

Again, after speaking to him, this area is mostly for references, so I really didn't get any specifics on what to include as far as an introductory passage for the links would be. I don't think this is severely high in priority however, so we'll make it up as we go.

<b>[AM]</b>
Finally, I wanted to mention that I showed Eduardo and Carlos the Burrough Elijah page and the tilex.fi site. They were v. impressed with both and like the ideas behind them.
I explained to Eduardo the idea of consolidating content to lessen the amount of pages, and he agrees with it so long as the content is expressed in a way that makes sense -- in other words, we have to show that this content works well as a single page, if we're going this route. Therefore, you have more creative freedom in terms of the design now.<br>
I'd like to point out too, that they were fond of the slide-out information bars and the contact forms on those pages, so maybe we can work something similar in. I think with the right tools, we can have probably the best local page in our hands, tbh. PR pages are pretty shit.

<br> 
If you have any other questions, let me know or call me.
