                        <p>Since markets and the economy are in constant flux, Business Valuations are no longer an option but a necessity. Business valuations is a set of procedures geared towards estimating the economic value of a business, part of a business or a specific asset. A business valuation report, completed by an accredited or certified valuation expert who is a member of a professional organization and is bound by its policies, procedures and professional standards, may be appropriate for use in courts, for financing and for tax purposes, as needed.</p>
